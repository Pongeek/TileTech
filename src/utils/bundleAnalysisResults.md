# Bundle Analysis Results

## Overview
This document contains the findings from the bundle analyzer that was run on the TileTech website project on July 9, 2023.

## Bundle Sizes

### App Router Routes
- `/` (home): 34.8 kB (131 kB first load JS)
- `/_not-found`: 138 B (87.6 kB first load JS)
- API routes: 0 B (server-side only)

### Pages Router Routes
- `/_app`: 0 B (81.2 kB first load JS)
- `/404`: 634 B (84.3 kB first load JS)
- `/500`: 645 B (84.3 kB first load JS)

### Shared Chunks
- Framework chunk: 44.8 kB
- Main chunk: 34.1 kB
- Other shared chunks: 8.72 kB

## Optimization Targets

Based on the analysis, we identified the following optimization targets:

1. **Component Lazy Loading**: 
   - Heavy UI components like ProjectModal
   - Below-the-fold sections (Projects, Testimonials, Contact)
   - ✅ Implemented with new lazyLoad utility

2. **Font Optimization**: 
   - Hebrew fonts (Frank Ruhl Libre, Heebo, Assistant)
   - Multiple font weights being loaded
   - ✅ Optimized with next/font system

3. **Third-party Libraries**:
   - Framer Motion
   - Swiper
   - ✅ Already handled with optimizePackageImports in next.config.js

4. **Image Optimization**:
   - ✅ Already using Next.js Image component with proper sizes

## Next Steps

1. Continue refining dynamic imports for more components
2. Consider further code splitting strategies
3. Monitor future bundle size changes
