- âœ… Inconsistent shadow implementations (FIXED)
- âœ… Different animation durations and styles (FIXED)
- âœ… Typography hierarchy needs standardization (FIXED)

#### 2. Mobile Experience
- âœ… Touch targets need optimization (minimum 44Ã—44px) (FIXED)
- âœ… Mobile navigation could be improved (FIXED)
- âœ… Form controls need better touch support (FIXED)
- âœ… Some spacing is too tight on mobile devices (FIXED)

#### 3. Animation & Interaction
- âœ… Lack of scroll-based animations for content sections (FIXED)
- âœ… Limited feedback on interactive elements (FIXED)
- Loading states could be more engaging (IN PROGRESS)
- Transition between states needs improvement (IN PROGRESS)

#### 4. Accessibility
- Some color contrast issues
- âœ… Missing focus states on interactive elements (FIXED)
- âœ… Reduced motion preferences not fully implemented (FIXED)
- Screen reader support needs enhancement
