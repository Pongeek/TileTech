# Performance Optimization Documentation

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve page load times and user experience on the TileTech website.

## Font Optimization (Subtask 12.1)

1. **Next.js Font System Implementation**
   - Set up Hebrew font optimization using `next/font/google`
   - Configured preloading and display:swap for Frank Ruhl Libre, Heebo, and Assistant fonts
   - Implemented CSS variables that allow seamless font usage in Tailwind

2. **Font Loading Strategy**
   - Preload only critical font weights (300, 400, 500, 700)
   - Automatic subsets with optimization for Hebrew and Latin characters
   - Removed duplicate font loading in _document.tsx

3. **CSS Improvements**
   - Configured proper font fallbacks
   - Updated Tailwind configuration to use CSS variables

## Bundle Analysis (Subtask 12.2)

Full analysis results are available in `src/utils/bundleAnalysisResults.md`. The key findings:
   - Home page first load JS: 131 kB
   - Core framework chunk: 44.8 kB
   - Main chunk: 34.1 kB

## Dynamic Imports Implementation (Subtask 12.3)

1. **LazyLoad Utility**
   - Created a reusable utility in `src/utils/lazyLoad.tsx` that:
     - Wraps React.lazy with proper error boundaries
     - Provides customizable loading skeletons
     - Ensures consistent lazy-loading implementation

2. **Component-Level Code Splitting**
   - Created lazy-loaded versions of hefty UI components:
     - ProjectModalLazy
     - ServiceCardLazy
     - BeforeAfterSliderLazy
     - TestimonialCardLazy
     - QuoteFormLazy

3. **Section-Level Code Splitting**
   - Created lazy-loaded versions of major page sections:
     - ServicesLazy
     - ProjectsLazy
     - TestimonialsLazy
     - ContactLazy

## React.lazy and Suspense Implementation (Subtask 12.4)

1. **Error Boundary Integration**
   - Added error boundaries to catch and handle lazy loading failures
   - Implemented fallback UI for error states

2. **Suspense Configuration**
   - Configured Suspense with skeleton loaders that match the design system
   - Used content-aware placeholder components that reflect the actual component's structure

3. **Loading Strategy**
   - Below-the-fold components load only when needed
   - Implemented progressive enhancement for slow connections

## Third-Party Library Optimization (Subtask 12.5)

1. **Package Import Optimization**
   - Configured Next.js' `optimizePackageImports` for:
     - framer-motion
     - swiper

2. **Conditional Loading**
   - Implemented code that only loads heavy animations and effects when the user doesn't prefer reduced motion

3. **Tree-Shaking Improvements**
   - Configured imports to leverage modern tree-shaking
   - Import only needed components from libraries

## Future Recommendations

1. **Image Optimization**
   - Continue using Next.js Image component for all images
   - Consider implementing a CDN for assets

2. **Monitoring**
   - Set up regular bundle size monitoring
   - Implement web vitals tracking

3. **Further Optimizations**
   - Consider implementing route-based code splitting as the site grows
   - Explore Service Worker implementation for offline capabilities and faster repeat visits
