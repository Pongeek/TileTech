      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the performance optimization and Vercel deployment task into specific subtasks covering image optimization, code splitting, caching, analytics setup, environment configuration, lighthouse audits, and deployment pipeline setup.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to its broad scope covering multiple optimization techniques, deployment configuration, and analytics integration. It also depends on all previous tasks, making it a critical integration point. The technical depth requires expertise in Next.js optimization features and Vercel deployment."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Next.js Image Optimization",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js Image optimization task into specific subtasks covering component replacement, responsive configuration, placeholder implementation, performance testing, and optimization for specific website sections.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity focused on a specific technical area. It requires systematic replacement of image tags throughout the site and configuration of various image optimization parameters. The task is well-defined but requires attention to detail across multiple website sections."

      "taskTitle": "Font and Code Optimization",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the font and code optimization task into specific subtasks covering font configuration, preloading strategies, dynamic imports implementation, bundle analysis, and component-level code splitting.",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to the technical depth required for both font optimization and code splitting. It involves both CSS configuration and JavaScript architecture changes. Bundle analysis and optimization requires specialized knowledge and careful implementation to avoid regressions."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 13,
      "taskTitle": "Caching and Environment Configuration",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the caching and environment configuration task into specific subtasks covering cache header setup, environment variable configuration, testing methodology, and verification procedures.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity focused on configuration rather than implementation. Setting up caching requires understanding of HTTP headers and Next.js configuration. Environment variable setup is straightforward but critical for production functionality. Testing and verification are essential components."

      "taskId": 14,
      "taskTitle": "Analytics Integration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the analytics integration task into specific subtasks covering installation and basic configuration, custom event setup, dashboard creation, and privacy compliance implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity requiring both technical implementation and strategic decisions about what to track. Setting up custom events requires coordination with business goals. Privacy considerations add complexity, and testing analytics implementation requires specialized approaches."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Vercel deployment configuration task into specific subtasks covering repository connection, build settings optimization, redirect and error page setup, domain configuration, and CI/CD pipeline testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to its critical nature for production deployment. It involves multiple configuration points and requires careful testing to ensure the deployment pipeline works correctly. The task integrates multiple previous tasks and serves as the final step before production launch."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the UI/UX enhancements task into specific subtasks covering animation implementation, interactive element improvements, accessibility enhancements, mobile optimization, loading state improvements, and responsive design refinements.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to its broad scope across the entire application and the subjective nature of UI/UX improvements. It requires both technical implementation skills and design sensibility. The task touches multiple components and requires careful testing across devices and browsers."
