      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the caching and environment configuration task into 4 specific subtasks, including configuration of different cache policies for various asset types, environment variable setup, testing procedures, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves technical configuration with moderate complexity. It requires understanding of caching mechanisms and environment variables, but follows standard patterns. The task has clear deliverables and testing requirements."

      "taskTitle": "Analytics Integration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the analytics integration task into 5 subtasks covering initial setup, custom event tracking implementation, dashboard creation, privacy controls, and testing/validation of the analytics system.",
      "reasoning": "Analytics integration involves both technical implementation and strategic decisions about what to track. The custom event tracking and privacy considerations add complexity, requiring coordination between frontend events and analytics configuration."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create 6 subtasks for the Vercel deployment configuration, including repository connection, build optimization, environment variable transfer, redirect/404 setup, domain configuration, and CI/CD pipeline testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to its critical nature (deployment failures affect the entire application) and the multiple interconnected components. It requires careful configuration of CI/CD pipelines, environment settings, and domain management."

      "taskTitle": "UI/UX Enhancements",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the UI/UX enhancements into 7 subtasks focusing on specific areas: scroll animations, interactive element improvements, color and contrast refinement, mobile optimization, navigation enhancements, loading state improvements, and cross-browser testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to its broad scope and subjective nature. It involves multiple design aspects across different device types and requires both technical implementation and aesthetic judgment. The enhancements touch many parts of the application."

      "taskTitle": "Photo Upload and Management System",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the photo upload and management system into 7 comprehensive subtasks: upload interface development, cloud storage integration, gallery view implementation, photo editing features, database schema and API development, performance optimization, and security/permission configuration.",
      "reasoning": "This is a highly complex task that essentially represents a complete feature subsystem. It involves frontend UI components, backend APIs, cloud storage integration, image processing, and performance considerations. The system has multiple interconnected parts and requires careful planning for user experience and technical implementation."
