      "taskTitle": "Set up Next.js project with RTL and Tailwind CSS configuration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js project setup with RTL and Tailwind CSS into specific implementation steps, including project initialization, RTL configuration, Tailwind setup with custom colors, Hebrew font integration, and basic layout component creation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical configurations (Next.js setup, RTL support, Tailwind CSS with custom theme, Hebrew fonts) and creating a foundational layout component. While each individual piece is straightforward, coordinating all these elements with proper RTL support increases complexity."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the hero section implementation into steps covering carousel library selection and integration, Next.js Image optimization configuration, Hebrew text placeholder styling, CTA button creation, and responsive design testing across devices.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing a carousel with Next.js requires third-party library integration, optimized image handling, and ensuring proper RTL support. The autoplay, pagination, and navigation controls add interactive complexity, while maintaining proper responsive behavior across devices increases the implementation challenge."

      "taskTitle": "Create filterable project gallery",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the filterable gallery implementation into steps covering data structure design, masonry grid layout, image optimization with Next.js, modal view creation, filter functionality, Hebrew text support, and responsive testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing multiple complex UI components: a masonry layout gallery, filtering system, and modal view for enlarged images. The combination of these features along with Next.js image optimization and proper RTL support makes this a technically challenging task."
